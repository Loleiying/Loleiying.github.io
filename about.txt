Education has taken me around the world. In 2013, it was the first time I went abroad, away from my family, to pursue my education in Singapore. The warm and beautiful insular country is situated in Southeast Asia, only a four-hour flight away from my hometown in Guangdong, China. Though much smaller than China, Singapore is an enormous cultural melting pot where inspirations mushroom. It was also the first time I experienced the world outside of my own through education and travel. 

The more I learn about the world, the more I understand how little knowledge I possess. This is, you might be familiar with, the Dunning-Kruger effect that describes a cognitive bias where people are overconfident despite their incompetency in a certain domain due to a lack of awareness of how little they know. As a child who skydived from the peak of "Mount Stupid" to the Valley of Despair, I quickly learned that listening first is always better than speaking first. Not only do I feel more curious about the topic of discussion, but I also have more time to analyze new information.


Summary:

I have always been facinated by numbers since I was a little kid. I could not get enough of the satisfaction from solving mathematical problems to get the exact numbers. The ability to quantifiably measure the world using statistics gives me confidence in real-world problems. 

Of course, I learned that not everything can be measured by numbers as I grow older, like how much my parents love me even though love is a unspoken language in our household. It is sometimes positively correlated with the number of calls we have in a week because we miss one another, yet sometimes negatively correlated with the number of calls because we do not want to disturb one another's busy schedules. My parents would probably be furious if they hear me measuring how much we love one another by the number of phone calls we have. 

Jokes aside, I love how numbers decompose the complexity of the problem into insights that are constructed into simple solutions. Being analytical and obsessed with numbers have become part of my identity that I carry into my academics and work. 

Graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computational and Data Science, I am experience in various industries including Marketing, Healthcare, and
